# Telephone_Conversation_Circuit
SabancÄ± University Fall 2021-2022 CS 303 Logic &amp; Digital System Design term project 

Main objective of this project is to design a sequential circuit for a simple one-sided telephone conversation and then implement it using Verilog HDL.
Basically, the caller will initiate a telephone conversation with the callee and the caller will send characters to the callee. The circuit will calculate the cost of the call and send the cost value and the characters (sent from the caller to callee) as outputs.
